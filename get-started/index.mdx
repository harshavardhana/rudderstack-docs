# Get Started

[**RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/) is a **customer data platform** to capture, process, and sync all of your event, product, and warehouse data to all the tools across your customer data stack.

RudderStack's backend is written in Go, with a simple, user-friendly UI written in React.js.

RudderStack is enterprise-ready and provides a powerful transformation framework to process your event data on the fly.

## RudderStack in 5 minutes

**The easiest way to get started with RudderStack is by [signing up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for [RudderStack Cloud](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/).**

Follow these steps to get up and running with RudderStack in no time:

- Once you complete the [**signup**](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup), you will get access to the RudderStack dashboard for setting up your data pipelines:

- Click on **Add Source** to set up a data source.

- You can choose the data source from the following three source categories supported by RudderStack:

  - [**Event Streams**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/): With these sources, you can collect your event data from all of your web, mobile, and server-side apps and route it to your preferred customer tools and data warehouses.
  - [**Cloud Extract**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/cloud-extract-sources/): With these sources, you can build ELT pipelines from cloud apps to your data warehouse.
  - [**Warehouse Actions**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/): With this option, you can leverage the enriched data residing in your data warehouse as a data source for your whole customer data stack.

- Once you have configured the source, add a destination in RudderStack by clicking on the **Add Destination** button.

- From the list of destinations, choose the destination you want to configure for the source. **RudderStack currently supports over 100 tool and data warehouse destinations.**

- Configure the destination by entering the relevant connection settings. For detailed information on the required settings, refer to that destination's [**documentation**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/).

- You can also leverage custom JavaScript functions in RudderStack to transform your events before sending them to your specified destinations.
