# Get Started

[**RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/) is a **customer data platform** to capture, process, and sync all of your event, product, and warehouse data to all the tools across your customer data stack. It is enterprise-ready and provides a powerful transformation framework to process your event data on the fly.

## RudderStack in 5 minutes

Follow these steps to set up a connection in RudderStack and start sending your data in no time:

1. Once you complete the [**signup**](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup), you will get access to the RudderStack dashboard for setting up your data pipelines:

2. Click on [**Add Source**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/) to set up a data source.

3. You can choose the data source from the following three source categories:

  - [**Event Streams**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/): With these sources, you can collect your event data from all of your web, mobile, and server-side apps and route it to your preferred customer tools and data warehouses.

  - [**Cloud Extract**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/cloud-extract-sources/): With these sources, you can build ELT pipelines from cloud apps to your data warehouse.

  - [**Warehouse Actions**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/): With this option, you can use the enriched data residing in your data warehouse as a source for your whole customer data stack.

4. Once you have configured the source, add a destination in RudderStack by clicking on the **Add Destination** button.

5. From the list of destinations, choose the destination you want to configure for the source. **RudderStack currently supports over 100 tool and data warehouse destinations.**

6. Configure the destination by entering the relevant connection settings. For detailed information on the required settings, refer to that destination's [**documentation**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/).

7. You can also use custom JavaScript functions in RudderStack to transform your events before sending them to your specified destinations.
