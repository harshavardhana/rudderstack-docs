This guide details the various aspects of setting up a connection in RudderStack.

## Setting up a connection

Setting up a connection in RudderStack involves the following steps:

- Setting up a [**source**](#sources)
- Configuring a [**destination**](#destinations) and connecting it to a source

Refer to our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> for step-by-step instructions on setting up a connection.
