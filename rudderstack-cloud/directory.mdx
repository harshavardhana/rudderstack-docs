# Directory

The Directory option in RudderStack Cloud can be located on the left navigation bar as shown below. It acts as a directory for all the source (Event Streams, Cloud Extract, Warehouse Actions) and destination platforms supported by RudderStack.


It can also be used to directly add a source or destination by clicking on the desired platform and configuring its settings.
