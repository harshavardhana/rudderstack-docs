# Sources

A **source** refers to a platform or an application (web, mobile, server-side, or a third-party cloud app) from where RudderStack tracks and collects your event data.

<div class="infoBlock">

  You can configure a source for every unique source of data. You can also create multiple sources for each website or application from which you want to track the data.
</div>

RudderStack Cloud provides **Sources** option in the left navigation bar that allows you to view all the configured sources in your RudderStack dashboard:

<div class="successBlock">

  RudderStack sources are classified into the following three
  categories. Refer to the respective documentation for more information:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/">Event Streams</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/cloud-extract-sources/">Cloud Extract</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/">Warehouse Actions</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

4. Assign a name to the source, and click **Next**.
5. Configure the source with the relevant connection settings.

Your source should be configured successfully.

  Setting up the data sources to ingest data from cloud apps might require
  some additional configuration. Refer to the relevant source documentation for
  more details.
</div>

**Important**: Note the source **Write Key**. This is required to configure the RudderStack SDK to track and collect events from the source platform.

## Source details

To get details about a configured source, click on it to see following view on the dashboard:

<img src="../assets/general/rudderstack-source-details.png" alt="RudderStack source details" />

These options can be explained as follows:

- **Rename**: Click on the edit icon next to the source name to rename the source:

- **Write Key**: It is required to send the data from your source.

For example, you can load [**RudderStack's JavaScript SDK**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) on your website to track and collect the events by running the following snippet:

```javascript
  rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, options);
```

- **Add Destination**: You can connect the source to a destination by clicking on this button.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, you can also use it by clicking on **Add Destination** > **Use Existing Destination**.
</div>

- **Live Events**: Once the source and destination are successfully configured and a connection is set up and enabled, RudderStack starts tracking and collecting events from your source. These events can be viewed in real-time using this option.

- **Events**: It displays all the latest metrics related to the event delivery such as number of events successfully delivered, failed events, etc. You can also filter these by time period.

- **Settings**: This option provides additional destination-related details, such as:  

  - **Enabled**: You can enable or disable syncing data from this source.

  - **Source ID**: This is the unique identifier associated with your source.

  - **Permanently delete source**: You can delete a source by clicking on the **Delete** button.

<div class="warningBlock">

Before deleting a source, make sure there are no destinations connected to it.
