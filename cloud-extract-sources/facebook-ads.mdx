# Facebook Ads

[**Facebook Ads**](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads) is an online advertising platform that lets you create and run cross-device marketing campaigns, as well as track their performance with easy to read reports. With Facebook Ads, you can create, publish and purchase ads across all Facebook platforms - including Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and Audience Network.

This guide will help you set up Facebook Ads as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Facebook Ads data and routes it to the supported [**warehouse destinations**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/).

<strong>All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a data warehouse destination.</strong>

- Log into your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com).

- Then, click on the **Directory** option in the left navigation bar and go to **Cloud Extract** under **Sources**. From the list of sources, click on **Facebook Ads**.

If you have already connected RudderStack to your Facebook account, your credentials should appear automatically under <strong>Use existing credentials</strong>.
</div>

### Configuring the source

- In the next screen, choose the **Page** from where you want RudderStack to import the data. Also, select the **Historical data** as well as the **Attribution window** timeframe, and click on **Next**.

  - **Historical Data** - This option sets the range for the first sync and can be used to fetch all the historical data.
  - **Attribution window** - This option sets the date range for any subsequent data sync.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack will not sync the data that is older than the specified timeframes.
</div>

### Setting the data update schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Facebook Ads account to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

That's it! Facebook Ads is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start importing data from Facebook Ads as per the specified frequency. You can then connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
